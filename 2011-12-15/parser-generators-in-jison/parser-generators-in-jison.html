      <h1>Parser Generators in Jison</h1>
      <div class="slide">
        You too can write a language like CoffeeScript in your browser! How?
        Use Jison!  It takes a context-free grammar that is described much
        like BISON and outputs a parser generator that let's you parse your
        own syntax by taking it as input to a parse method and provides the
        results as output.

      <h1>What is a parser generator?</h1>
      <div class="slide">
        A parser generator (also known as a compiler-compiler) takes
        your language specification (a context-free grammar) and
        generates a parser in the language of your choice.  That
        parser can then take any syntax described by your initial
        grammar and generate output.

      <h1>Some examples of popular parser generators:</h1>

      <div class="slide">
        <ul>
          <li>Bison (C, C++, Java)</li>
          <li>Yacc (C, ML, Ada, Pascal, Java, Python, Ruby, Common Lisp)</li>
          <li>Antlr (Ada95, ActionScript, C, C#, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, Perl, Python,Ruby)</li>
          <li>Jison (Javascript) - used to generate the parser for CoffeeScript</li>

      <h1>What is a context-free grammar and how do I write one?</h1>

      <div class="slide">
        Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is the original notation for writing a
        contex-free grammar for describing Algol 60.  While this
        syntax can be essentially parsed by Bison with a few minor
        syntax tweaks, I like to think of BNF as the classical "meta"
        parser specification.

    <section id="slide5" class="slide">
      <h1 class="slide">BNF starts out by describing rules in this format:</h1>
      <div class="slide">
        <pre>
          <code>
            &lt;symbol&gt; ::= __expression__
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>

      <div class="slide">
        The <strong>symbol</strong> represents the nonterminals which make up the language
        while the <strong>expression</strong> (which can contain symbols) describes what
        the symbols replace.

        For example, let's describe a quick BNF for a zip code:
      </div>

      <div class="slide">
        <pre>
          <code>
            &lt;digit&gt; ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
            &lt;zip_code&gt; ::= &lt;digit&gt;&lt;digit&gt;&lt;digit&gt;&lt;digit&gt;&lt;digit&gt;-&lt;digit&gt;&lt;digit&gt;&lt;digit&gt;&lt;digit&gt;
          </code>

      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="slide7" class="slide">
      <div class="slide">
        The <strong>|</strong> character allows optional patterns that
        allow the matching of the <strong>digit</strong> symbol to
        represent a single value that is between 0 and 9.  You will
        also notice that the <strong>-</strong> between the digit
        symbols is not a symbol and is considered part of the symantecs
        of the structure that we will parse.

        But sometimes, zip codes don't always have the last 4 digits, how can
        we accept a 5-digit zip code as well as a 9-digit zip code? Like this:

      <div class="slide">
        <pre>
          <code>
    &lt;digit&gt; ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
    &lt;zip_code&gt; ::= &lt;zip_standard&gt; | &lt;zip_standard&gt;-&lt;zip_last_four&gt;
    &lt;zip_standard&gt; :: &lt;digit&gt;&lt;digit&gt;&lt;digit&gt;&lt;digit&gt;&lt;digit&gt;

    <section id="slide9" class="slide">
      <div class="slide">
        We can describe that optional format simply by building on
        the <strong>symbol ::= expression</strong>
        and <strong>|</strong> rules that we are provided with by BNF.

        <ul>
          <li>It's fairly simple to use.</li>
          <li>It tokenizes (similar to flex) and parses for you.</li>
          <li>It uses the same synax as Bison with some minor differences.</li>
          <li>You can parse your own syntax in the browser allowing you to do some gnarly things given enough creative energy or you can use it on the command line on most POSIX systems through npm. See the Jison website for details.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Separating your lexical analysis and state management
            using only a regular expressions model is very difficult.</li>
          <li>You could use regular expressions, but then you will have two

        When I was a young padawan programmer, I wrote a language parser for
        production use using case statements and regular expressions.  It was
        difficult to maintain because:

      <ul>
        <li>The regular expressions were long and quite unwieldy to modify

          correctly</li>
        <li>I had large case statements with several branches and several
          options that were passed by value</li>

        Most of this can be handled by the parser generator that you are
        using for your language.  I didn't understand the significance of
        what I was doing and eventually that project was abandoned.

      <h1>Is this just for programming languages?</h1>

      <div class="slide">
        No! Anything that you need to parse can be described using a
        context-free grammar. This includes turing-complete languages, but
        also extends to domain-specific languages, protocols and document
        specifications like YAML or XML.

      If you ever find yourself parsing something custom in javascript
      repeatedly with variations, consider using Jison. It could make your
